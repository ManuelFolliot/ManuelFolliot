### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:wave: My name is Manuel. I'm a former highschool teacher in history and geography. I decided to change direction and become a web developper, specializing in back end.

:mortar_board: I'm currently in training at O'Clock, learning JS, PHP, Laravel and Symfony. I'll be an intern at Science Edu, starting at the end of April.
:floppy_disk: I try to upload updates on personal projects every week, feel free to give any feedback !
